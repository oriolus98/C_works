# Fisdarling code & love
Final assignment for my course on 'Introduction to programming', while studying Physics Bachelor at Universitat de Val√®ncia.

The script 'fisdarling_code.cpp' implements in C++ the basic functionalities of a partner seeking app: loading of an small database from an external file ('usuarisfis.txt'); inserting, modifying or deleting clients from the database; as well as a recommendation algorithm for a top-five of partner candidates, based on distance or personal tastes. This was my first approach to programming.
